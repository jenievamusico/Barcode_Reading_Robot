1. what can your robot do?
Our Robot is able to scan a barcode and save the data into the brick. After the data from the barcode is saved,
the Robot exports it as a csv file to Matlab where it will be interpreted.

2. what can't your robot do?
Our robot is capable of performing all the functionalities required for this project.It might not be capable of 
reading a barcode that is too small due to the colour sensor not being sensitive enough for that.

3. what have you observed as differences between the virtual and physical twin?
The data looks smoother in the vitual twin since there is less noise. For the virtual twin, the motor speed values
are higher so the code needs to be adjusted to read the values of the difference between peaks.

4. other comments you wish to forward to developers working on this project in the future, or users of your product.
For the Physical twin, keep the Motor Speed values low so that the robot can get a better reading of the barcode.
